Coding Challenge #1
Mark and John are trying to compare their BMI (Body Mass Index), which is 
calculated using the formula:
BMI = mass / height ** 2 = mass / (height * height) (mass in kg 
and height in meter).
Your tasks:
1. Store Mark's and John's mass and height in variables
2. Calculate both their BMIs using the formula (you can even implement both 
versions)
3. Create a Boolean variable 'markHigherBMI' containing information about 
whether Mark has a higher BMI than John.
Test data:
ยง Data 1: Marks weights 78 kg and is 1.69 m tall. John weights 92 kg and is 1.95 
m tall.

Solution:

let markmass, markheight, johnmass, johnheight; /*Test 1*/
markmass = 78; markheight = 1.69; johnmass = 92; johnheight = 1.95;
let bmimark, bmijohn;
bmimark = markmass / (markheight * markheight);
bmijohn = johnmass / (johnheight * johnheight);
console.log(bmimark);
console.log(bmijohn);

let markhigherbmi;

console.log(markhigherbmi = bmimark > bmijohn);

if (bmimark > bmijohn) {
    console.log(`"Mark BMI ${bmimark} is Higher then John BMI ${bmijohn}"`);
} else {
    console.log(`"John BMI ${bmijohn} is Higher then Mark BMI ${bmimark}"`);
}
